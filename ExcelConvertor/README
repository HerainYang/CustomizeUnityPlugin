Put it in Assets/Editor, if don't have such directory, create one.
Only support csv so far, supporting of xlsm, xls and so on might coming later (depend on needing XD).
Modify "Constant.RawXMLPath" and "Constant.JsonRootPath" to change the default searching path of excel file and the default exporting path of json file.
Implement the json type before using this plugin.
